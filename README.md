# DSC510-Data-Visualization-and-Charts
 An assignment for DSC510 at GCU that focused on creating charts and evaluating their effectiveness at communicating insights for a real-world dataset.

I recorded a video going over my findings, check it out [here.](https://youtu.be/4H4u5JtewKI)

# Assignment Instructions
In this assignment, you will create effective data visualizations for a given dataset using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly. You will apply principles of chart design to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of data visualizations, and communicate data insights to a specific audience using appropriate language and visual cues.

Instruction Prompts:

1. Locate a dataset (e.g., from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository) from the list of "Repositories for Finding Suitable Datasets," located in Class Resources, or use one provided by your instructor. The dataset should include at least 8 variables or different types.
2. Using Python and appropriate data visualization libraries, create at least two different visualizations for each variable in the dataset selected in Prompt 1 above. Your visualizations should include at least one bar chart, one line chart, one scatter plot, and one histogram.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of your visualizations and identify at least two areas for improvement based on principles of chart design (e.g., clarity, simplicity, consistency).
4. Using your improved visualizations, create a final report that communicates data insights to a specific audience. The report should include appropriate language and visual cues for the intended audience.

Requirements:
Jupyter notebook containing all Python code used in the tasks.
Include written responses to each task prompt, using markdown cells in the same Jupyter notebook.
Include visual aids to support your answers.
Include references in APA style.
Record a short video (4–5 minutes) explaining your work and highlighting key findings. Use an online video platform such as Loom, YouTube, or Vimeo to upload your completed video.
Deliverables:

Submit a Jupyter notebook containing all Python code, written responses, and visual aids.
Include the link to your video recording.
While APA style is not required for the body of this assignment, solid writing reflecting industry appropriate standards is expected. Remember to reference all datasets and resources according to using APA formatting guidelines, which can be found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center.

This assignment uses a rubric. Please review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.
